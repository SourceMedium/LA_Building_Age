HTML to load Map tiles from cityhub server host // Breakdown on the processes involved in developing map will be up soon.

Since 2008, there are over 2.9 million buildings in Los Angeles County. 
Each building is shaded according to the time they were built. 
Map made with Mapbox Studio and MapboxGL by [Omar Ureta](http://www.theworks.la), inspired by Portland, Oregon: The Age of a City

Notes

 * Grey areas indicate no data on year building was built.
 * Building outline data shows what existed in 2008, buildings during the century may have been replaced and is not shown with this set.

From these sources:

  * LARAIC2 and LA County Assessor 
 
Using this map will ask more questions about LA's development and it should continue to evolve and explore these inquiries. Maps should be [transformative agents](http://www.thepolisblog.org/2010/03/mapping-as-transformative-agent-in.html)
